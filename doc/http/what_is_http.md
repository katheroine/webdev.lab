# What is HTTP

> **HTTP** (**Hypertext Transfer Protocol**) is an *application layer* protocol in the *Internet Protocol* (*IP*) suite model for distributed, collaborative, *hypermedia* information systems.
> *HTTP* is the foundation of data communication for the *World Wide Web* (*WWW*), where *hypertext* documents include *hyperlinks* to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.
>
> Development of *HTTP* was initiated by *Tim Berners-Lee* at *CERN* in *1989* and summarized in a simple document describing <mark>the behavior of a client and a server</mark> using the first HTTP version, named *0.9*. That version was subsequently developed, eventually becoming the public *1.0*.
>
> Development of early HTTP Request for Comments (RFC) documents started a few years later in a coordinated effort by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with work later moving to the IETF.
