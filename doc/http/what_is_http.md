# What is HTTP

> **HTTP** (**Hypertext Transfer Protocol**) is an *application layer* protocol in the *Internet Protocol* (*IP*) suite model for distributed, collaborative, *hypermedia* information systems.
> *HTTP* is the foundation of data communication for the *World Wide Web* (*WWW*), where *hypertext* documents include *hyperlinks* to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.
>
> Development of *HTTP* was initiated by *Tim Berners-Lee* at *CERN* in *1989* and summarized in a simple document describing *the behavior of a client and a server* using the first HTTP version, named *0.9*. That version was subsequently developed, eventually becoming the public *1.0*.
>
> Development of early HTTP Request for Comments (RFC) documents started a few years later in a coordinated effort by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with work later moving to the IETF.

> **HTTP** stands for *Hyper Text Transfer Protocol*
>
> WWW is about communication between web clients and servers
>
> Communication between client computers and web servers is done by sending *HTTP Requests* and receiving *HTTP Responses*

> **HTTP** is an *application-layer* protocol for transmitting *hypermedia* documents, such as *HTML*. It was designed for communication between *web browsers* and *web servers*, but it can also be used for other purposes, such as machine-to-machine communication, programmatic access to *APIs*, and more.
>
> HTTP follows a classical *client-server* model, with a *client* opening a connection to make a *request*, then waiting until it receives a response from the *server*. HTTP is a *stateless protocol*, meaning that the server does not keep any *session* data between two requests, although the later addition of *cookies* adds state to some client-server interactions.
